# MATH 14 — Skeletal Notes

PreTeXt book of *skeletal* (fill-in) lecture notes for SCU's MATH 14
(vector calculus: line integrals, multiple integrals, and the big
theorems). Students complete them by hand — printed, or annotated on an
iPad over the PDF — while the derivation is done in class.

Deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/pretext-deploy.yml`.

## Where the content comes from

This repository started as a copy of the **completed** MATH 14 notes, and
the 18 lecture sections of `source/` were then hollowed out **in place**:
same file names, same `xml:id`s, same figures. There is no parallel set of
`sec-skel-*` files and no `skel-` prefix, unlike the MATH 13 skeletal book
(`mahmadi-ops/M13-Skeletal-Instructor`), because here the skeletal version
*is* the book. The completed notes live in their own repository; to see what
a box used to contain, look there, or at this repository's history before
the skeletonizing commits.

The book has four chapters. The first three are the skeletal sections:

| Chapter | Files |
| --- | --- |
| 1 · Line Integrals | `section-parametrization`, `section-arc-length`, `section-line-integrals`, `section-vector-fields`, `conservative-fields` |
| 2 · Multiple Integrals | `double-integrals-rectangles`, `double-integrals-general-regions`, `polar-coordinates`, `double-integrals-polar-form`, `triple-integrals-rectangular`, `triple-integrals-cylindrical`, `triple-integrals-spherical`, `mass-center-of-mass`, `jacobian-substitution`, `surface-integrals` |
| 3 · The Big Theorems | `greens-theorem`, `stokes-theorem`, `divergence-theorem` |

The fourth, **Assignments and Review Problems** (`hw*-online.ptx`,
`review*-practice.ptx`, plus the `hw*-exercises`/`hw*-solutions` files they
include), is **not skeletal** and must not be touched by a skeletonizing
pass: those are the auto-graded problem sets with the AI tutor, and their
solutions are released per assignment through `<version include="..."/>`
in `publication/publication.ptx` (see the comment there). The skeletal
sections cite ids in these files and vice versa; every `xml:id` was kept
so that nothing had to be rewired.

`section-arc-length-old.ptx`, `cone-plane-arc-length.ptx`,
`cylindrical-element-instructions.ptx` and `hw1-paragraphs.ptx` are not
included from `main.ptx`; leave them alone.

## The skeletonizing recipe

See `.claude/skills/skeletonize/SKILL.md` for the full rules and the
helper scripts. In short:

- **Keep** objectives, definitions, theorem statements, `assemblage`
  summaries, problem statements, videos, interactives, and every figure
  that is either part of a statement or the *check* on a computation.
- **Replace** every derivation, proof, worked solution and Concept Check
  answer with a blank `latex-image` workspace box (15 wide, height to
  fit, faint rules between labelled rows), preceded by a **one- to
  three-sentence parenthetical instruction** naming what to do and which
  numbered result to use — not how. The calibration target is
  `source/section-parametrization.ptx`, which mirrors the MATH 13 book's
  `sec-skel-geom-parametrization.ptx`.
- A numbered result that a later section or an assignment cites
  (`eq-mass-speed`, `eq-polar-area-element`, `eq-sphere-cross`, …) is
  restated in an `<assemblage>` right after the box that derives it, so
  the id survives.
- Figures that *answer* an exercise (the parabola plotted from a table,
  a region of integration the student must find, a projection) become
  empty grids to draw on, under the same `xml:id`. Captions that stated an
  answer are trimmed to "compare with what you found".
- Each section file opens with a comment recording what was kept, what
  was hollowed, and what was done with the figures.

## Building

```bash
pretext build web        # output/web
pretext build print      # output/print (the PDF students annotate)
scripts/build-site.sh    # both, with the PDF copied into output/web
pretext view web
```

Check well-formedness and cross-references before a build — it is far
faster than reading the log:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/skeletonize/xrefs.py --check
```

### The PDF button

The navbar carries a **PDF** button linking to `math14-skeletal-notes.pdf`
next to the HTML pages. Three pieces have to stay in step:

- `project.ptx` — the print target's `output-filename`.
- `scripts/build-site.sh` — copies that file into `output/web/`.
- `assets/custom.js` — `PDF_HREF`, the button it injects into the navbar.

`scripts/build-site.sh` is what CI runs; a plain `pretext build web`
leaves the button hidden (it checks for the file before showing itself).

Do **not** give the print target a `deploy-dir`: that makes it a deploy
target, which switches `pretext deploy` to Pelican and would publish all of
`output/print` rather than the one PDF.

### Two root files

`source/main.ptx` is the web book; `source/main-print.ptx` is the root of
the print and latex targets and differs only in leaving out the
"Assignments and Review Problems" chapter and using
`frontmatter-print.ptx` (no `introduction.ptx`, which is about the web
features). The Runestone fill-in problems print as their regex answer
patterns plus "Correct." feedback lines, so that chapter is web-only. The
shared `<docinfo>` lives in `source/docinfo.ptx`. A structural change to
`main.ptx` (a new chapter or section) must be mirrored in
`main-print.ptx`; nothing in the print tree may `<xref>` into the problems
chapter.

### Two publication files

`publication/publication.ptx` (web) and `publication/publication-print.ptx`
(print, latex) must carry the same `<version include="..."/>` list, so a
released set of solutions appears in both the site and the PDF. Edit both
when releasing.

### Videos and interactives in the PDF

Every `<video>` in the sections carries `preview="play-button.png"`
(`assets/play-button.png`, a plain play-button still): PreTeXt prints a
local-file video as its preview image plus a QR code, and without a
preview it prints "BUG: PREVIEW NOT HANDLED". (`preview="generic"` needs
a play-button asset that this pretext version, 2.37.1, does not ship.) Interactives get
an automatic screenshot plus a QR code. Both QR codes are absolute links
built from `<baseurl>` in the publication files, which must be the deployed
site's address. A new video needs the attribute too.

## Traps

- XML comments may not contain `--` (write the aside in parentheses).
- A bare `<` or `>` inside a `latex-image` that is not wrapped in `CDATA`
  has to be written `&lt;` / `&gt;`. The empty grids use `CDATA` for this
  reason (`>=stealth`).
- `\$` in a `latex-image` is a *literal* dollar, so any math after it lands
  in text mode and LaTeX fails.
- The print build can exhaust xelatex's main memory on a book with
  hundreds of tikz pictures; the workflow raises `extra_mem_top`/`_bot`,
  and `scripts/build-site.sh` refuses a truncated PDF by page count.
